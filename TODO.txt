- Fix/implement rotation and translation matrices and functions: 
	think on how to model the data transfer between different meshes. Will they all be pointers to meshes or global variables?
	This will influence how we model the mesh transform functions.
	(DONE ✅️)
	
- Organize code structure in general - clean the code 
(DONE ✅️)

- Fix obj3d and meshes structure->I need to find way of dynamically transfering data between meshes and mesh states without
(DONE ✅️ I just needed to clear the meshbufferout at the start of each frame)

- Fix the way objs and meshes are shared between functions (global variable vs double pointer as func parameters)

- Code is a mess! clean and organize everything
